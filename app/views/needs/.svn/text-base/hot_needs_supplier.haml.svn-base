/I created a table having 7 columns,the first for the number, 2nd for the photo of need,
/the 3rd for the name of need, 4th for the total number of needers.The last 3 columns for
/the buttons that link to track, place offer and the show page of each need.
/The if statement checks if there are any hot needs.In this case, it fills the table with the 
/info of those needs, else a message is displayed: "no available hot needs now".

%h3 Hot needs
-if @needs.empty?
  = render 'no_hot_needs'
-else
  = render 'hot_needs'
